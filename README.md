# cypressTesting
I desired to learn about Cypress.io so that I'll know for myself if it's worth recommending. So far I like it!

Stated with dotnet new mvc in .Net Core 3.0 and trying out Cypress.io

Quick start

https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html#article

npm install cypress --save-dev
npx cypress open

"It is impossible for Cypress to miss elements when it fires events."
